# nano
Set of python functions to perform electronic transport calculation on 2D-nanomaterials.
nanobtl is a python library used to run everything else. Install it first with "python3 setup.py install".
Then Examples.ipynb gives some examples of transport computation for a sheet of graphene with defects, and AC admittance calculation for a carbon nanotube.
The folder CAP optimization contains an algorithm to optimize a Complex Absorbing Potential on a specific system. There is a manual with all there is to know to run it inside.
